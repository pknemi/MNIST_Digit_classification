# MNIST_Digit_classification
MNIST Dataset: 60,000 training images, 10,000 test images (28Ã—28 grayscale digits).

Model Training & Evaluation:

Used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for classification.

Applied Dropout & Batch Normalization to improve performance.

Loss Function: SparseCategoricalCrossentropy -for multi-class classification.

Optimizer: Adam-for efficient learning.

Results & Performance

Training Accuracy: 99%

Validation Accuracy: 98%

Loss decreases,accuracy increases across epochs. CNN effectively recognize handwritten digits.
